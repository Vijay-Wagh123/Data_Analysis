# Pandas Data Analysis Project

## About Pandas

**Pandas** is an open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools. Key features include:

- **DataFrames**: Two-dimensional labeled data structures with columns of potentially different types.
- **Series**: One-dimensional labeled arrays.
- **Data Cleaning**: Tools for handling missing data, duplications, and data transformation.
- **Data Analysis**: Operations for grouping, merging, and pivoting data.
- **Data Visualization**: Integration with libraries like matplotlib and seaborn for creating plots.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on data analysis using the pandas library on a dataset from Udemy. The goal is to explore and extract insights from the dataset through various data manipulation and visualization techniques.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about Udemy courses, including:

- **Course Title**: The name of the course.
- **Number of Subscribers**: The number of users enrolled in the course.
- **Course Duration**: The length of the course in hours.
- **Rating**: The average rating of the course.

### Description

The project includes several Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that:

- **Clean the Data**: Address missing values, data type issues, and outliers.
- **Transform the Data**: Aggregate and reshape the data for analysis.
- **Visualize the Data**: Create charts and graphs to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Analyze Trends**: Examine relationships between different features of the courses.

### Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Scripts for preprocessing and cleaning the dataset.
- **Data Transformation**: Techniques for aggregating and reshaping the data.
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots and charts to visualize key metrics.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Detailed exploration of trends and patterns in Udemy course data.

### Installation
